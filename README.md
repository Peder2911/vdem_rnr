# VDEM institutions RNR

Reproduction and update of analysis from an upcoming article.

Depends on [this library](http://github.com/peder2911/timelib).

There are several scripts, that must be run in succession. Each script
populates the cache folder with data objects that can then be used to create
tables and plots.

main.R creates several tables, both table_1 and tables included in the
appendix. battledeaths.R creates the model /table of battledeath predictions,
while ISROC creates the in-sample ROC plot.
