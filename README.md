Reproduction and update of analysis from an upcoming article.

Depends on [this library](http://github.com/peder2911/timelib).

There are several scripts, that must be run in succession. Each script
populates the cache folder with data objects that can then be used to create
tables and plots.

Run the script "main.R" to execute the scripts in the correct order to create the
plots and tables used in the article.
